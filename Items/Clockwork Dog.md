Clockwork Dog
Touching the trinket blinds you and makes you feel as if you were drifting in a warm sea. After some moments, you see a figure bathed in white light. Your eyes adjust to the light and you realise that Thwip stands in front of you:

Nessa, thanks for coming to Hundelstone and helping us to understand what's happening with Those Who Harp.

Since the giants started appearing all over Faer√ªn we expected our network to react like it has countless times before: leveraging our advantage of being everywhere and nowhere to bring down those that want to unbalance power across the continent. We prevented the rise of Tiamat not so long ago, Tiamat! So, why wouldn't it be the same with giants?

Alas, it's not the case. Information flows to prevent what seems to be a major event and when the day comes it is nothing but show with no substance. Stone Giants attacking small settlements when they were just walking aimlessly and attacking any village in front of them or maybe orcs doing random raids aided by a "giant group" that seems to vanish by the time they are confronted.

But, we learn about Nightstone falling into Zhentarim hands or Goldenfields being attacked by several Hill Giant raids weeks later.

I don't know what to make out of this since every time I ask Krowen about it, he just leans in and tells me that the High Harpers know better than any Harpshadow or Brightcandle that gets stressed because their big scoop wasn't THE big scoop.

Nimblehand, I hope you manage to have better luck than us at untangling this, for the sake of our organisation.

As he finishes saying that, you come back to your senses, the world no longer being a white veil and you realise that just a second has passed since you touched the dog...
