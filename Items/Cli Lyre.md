Lyre, **requires attunement**

---

You can use an action to play the instrument and cast
one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to
cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until
the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability
and spell save DC.

---

When you use the instrument to cast a spell that
causes targets to become charmed on a failed save, the
targets have disadvantage on the saving throw. This
effect applies whether you are using the instrument as
the source of the spell or as a spellcasting focus.

Spells: **Fly, invisibility, levitate, protection from evil and good, stone shape, wall of fire, windwall**
