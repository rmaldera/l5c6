# Pocket Cloud Divination Stone

\#item 

A boulder with lines and runes engraved all over its surface. By tracing specific lines:

* A creature can use an action to cast the **control weather** spell or the **divination** spell from the stone. Once either spell its cast, this property can’t be used again for 7 days.
* A creature can use an action to shrink the stone to the size of a 6-inch-diameter orb weighing 25 pounds, or enlarge the boulder to its normal size (15-foot diameter) and weight (12 tons). Anything the enlarged boulder falls on takes 10d10 bludgeoning damage. A creature can avoid taking this damage by tumbling out of the way with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Once the reducing or enlarging effect is used, this property can’t be used again for 24 hours.
