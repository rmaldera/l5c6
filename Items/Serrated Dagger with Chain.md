\#item #guybrush 

**Weapon (dagger)**

This dagger with expertly crafted jagged edges has a fine chain attached to it. 

You can use a bonus action to make a DC 9 Strength (Athletics) check to retrieve the dagger after it is thrown. If the dagger was embedded in a creature, it takes 1d4 piercing damage if you succeed in retrieving the weapon.
