# Hizoulâ€™s Fire Commanding Ring

\#item 

This ring made of hardened magma has 6 charges left. While attuned to the ring,  a creature can expend 1 charge to cast **conjure minor elementals** (summoning either four magma mephits or four magmins, as the wearer wishes) or **fire shield** (warm shield version only) from the ring. 

Once all of its charges are spent, the ring loses its spellcasting properties but retains its resizing property.
