# The Ethereal Cutlass

**Longsword, Rare**

You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This blade deals psychic damage instead of slashing damage, and, if you can sense them, it can damage creatures in the Ethereal Realm while you're in the Prime Material Realm and vice versa.
