# Eilistraee Spider

\#item #house-itar-antoch

**Wondrous item, uncommon**

This item resembles a spider with minimal engraving on the outside. As a bonus action, you can say the spider’s command word and it’ll open to show a complex shiny engraving of a sword-wielding , dancing female drow silhouetted against the full moon.

Touching the engraving heals a creature 1d4 and removes the light from the object. The spider regains its healing properties at dawn.
