### Character Background

Iryanar belongs to House Phiarlan, an elven dragonmarked house in the world of Eberron. 

To the public Phiarlan is a house of entertainment comprised of bards, actors, artists and acrobats, though in secret, have also had a sub-sect of Horizon Walkers whose singular mission has been to prevent a repeat of the attempted Quori invasion of Eberron over 40000 years ago. 

The quori are nightmarish beings from the plane of Dal Quor, the Region of Dreams. The quori lifecycle is somehow connected to Eberron; specifically, each new Age on Eberron changes the nature of Dal Quor, causing the otherwise immortal Quori to die and be reborn into a form more fitting to the new age. Over 40,000 years ago (-40,000 YK), the Quori invaded Xen'drik from the plane of Dal Quor. 

After 1,000 years of battle, the giants call upon the most powerful magics of the dragons to throw Dal Quor out of planar alignment, forever sealing that plane away from Eberron.  Phiarlanian elves passed down through ages lores about the Giant-Quori War. 

After the giants were reduced to savages, these lores were all that were left as a reminder of the Quori’s ultimate aim to prevent the dawning of another new age on Eberron. The secretive sect of Phiarlanian elves swore to guard the planar portals to prevent another Quori invasion, and through generations have kept a watch over them. 

They now sense increased, unexplained forces that could herald an oncoming invasion, and bear the mantle of uniting and preparing Eberron to face an invasion. Among the many plans set in motion, Irianar’s quest was to seek and bring the Storm Giants of the Forgotten Realms to Eberron to unite the giants of Eberron.
