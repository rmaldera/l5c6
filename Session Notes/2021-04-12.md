# Strong Start

### Recap:

* The team confirmed a few things from Centria, including more details about the location of a cult-relevant location in Deepwater Isle and the split between the Justiciar' forces and the Dux/Praetor ones.
* The team confirmed a few things from Centria, including more details about the location of a cult-relevant location in Deepwater Isle and the split between the Justiciar' forces and the Dux/Praetor ones.
  * When taking Centria through the portal to Mirabar, the local Harper guardian advised you to make contact with *Irom*, blue-skinned orc with an ear full of rings who seems to be working for the Harpers. They also mentioned to be careful when using the portals since the cases against the Harpers seem to be going up in intensity.
* Team Waterdeep managed to get to the market and they worked with the guards to get the box with the rings without raising additional suspicions from them. Using one of them, they managed to get to
* Team Mirabar managed to get to the Gleaming Sun where the party was raging and the crowd was admiring a new band and a relic from Fire Giants that were active near the region. The team managed to renegotiate the contract: once Ossap hears that the situation is under control in Waterdeep, they will make contact with the party again so they can go to the Lost Peaks in the middle of the High Forest to retrieve an Sky Writing artifact.

### Start:

* Team Waterdeep finished their business in the square while Team Mirabar just came through the portal. For simplicity, they managed to find each other as they go down towards the griffon.

# Scenes

* Fight with the assassins group

# Secret and Clues

Check off when revealed.

* [ ] Diga changes the location of their meetups constantly. Just a few around town know where the next one is going to be. It's very likely that we won't meet here for weeks.
* [ ] Harpers are trying to do their best but their hand are tied. The murders across other cities put them in the wrong foot of the Lord's Alliance. They are hoping that helping the biggest city will give them some additional clout with authorities so they can relax.
* [ ] Spies around Waterdeep that are being quite obvious. It's a weird technique where one of them makes it obvious to draw your attention while in reality others are the one taking note of you, your possessions, etc.
  * [ ] Dwarves and Halflings working together.
* [ ] They've been trying to get the spies for a while after the previous success. They are sure they meet or leave messages in Deepwater Isle but they don't have the magical means (or skills) to ensure they aren't detected.
* [ ] As enforcers of the group they have been wearing second skins for ages to avoid the initial effects of the rings.
