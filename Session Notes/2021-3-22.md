# Secret and Clues

Check off when revealed.

* [ ] Diga changes the location of their meetups constantly. Just a few around town know where the next one is going to be. It's very likely that we won't meet here for weeks.
* [ ] Waterdeep is an obvious choice because of its size and how easy is to go around the authorities.
* [ ] Harpers are trying to do their best but their hand are tied. The murders across other cities put them in the wrong foot of the Lord's Alliance. They are hoping that helping the biggest city will give them some additional clout with authorities so they can relax.
* [ ] Spies around Waterdeep that are being quite obvious. It's a weird technique where one of them makes it obvious to draw your attention while in reality others are the one taking note of you, your possessions, etc.
  * [ ] Dwarves and Halflings working together.
* [ ] They've been trying to get the spies for a while after the previous success. They are sure they meet or leave messages in Deepwater Isle but they don't have the magical means (or skills) to ensure they aren't detected.
* [x] The cult has 4 levels of hierarchy as far as they know: Dux, Praetor, Justiciar, Hierophant.
  * [x] The praetor is definitely a noble in the city or from a merchant family. Enough connections around the city.
  * [x] Duces (at least Diga) don't seem to have their own intelligence network. They rely on underground contacts and the information relayed by the Justiciar's network.
* [x] They are almost certain that the City Guard has been infiltrated or maybe even higher? That would be the only explanation why the cult has not been given all the resources and bigger priorities.
  * [x] Also, although there is a sudden decrease in Giant activity most cities are still wary of that and can't just devote resources to Waterdeep.
* [x] As enforcers of the group they have been wearing second skins for ages to avoid the initial effects of the rings.
* [x] Psionic Rings need a ritual and power word to activate them. Mind blasts until your intelligence halves.
  * [x] The effect is for show.
* [x] Wizards can use mind blades to cut the tendrils
