# Strong Start

### Recap:

* The party made their way out of the crypt after noticing additional efforts to cover up references to Selune in the crypts. After checking their maps, they decided to find a way upriver towards the Sumber Hills. On their way there, they noticed a group of armored cultists and Tamar - following his oath of vengeance - led the charge to make them pay.
* The group was led by what seemed to be a paladin of Shar and shadowed by another cultist that made sure nobody could interrogate them.
  * The paladin had with them a note from Sigbert, the cult's religious leader.

### Start:

* The party just finished going over the cultists.
