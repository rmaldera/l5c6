# Strong Start

### Recap:

* The team reunited after getting the rings from Centria and Mirabar folks came back to the city. You took the time to discuss some of your next steps and decided to get a carriage close to The Griffon.
  * On your way up you were intercepted by a group of cultists.

# Scenes

* Fighting against assassin and cultists
* Check the lights around the Mud Flats and the Deepwater Isle
* Fight with the assassins group

# Secret and Clues

Check off when revealed.

* [ ] Diga changes the location of their meetups constantly. Just a few around town know where the next one is going to be. It's very likely that we won't meet here for weeks.
* [ ] Harpers are trying to do their best but their hand are tied. The murders across other cities put them in the wrong foot of the Lord's Alliance. They are hoping that helping the biggest city will give them some additional clout with authorities so they can relax.
* [ ] Spies around Waterdeep that are being quite obvious. It's a weird technique where one of them makes it obvious to draw your attention while in reality others are the one taking note of you, your possessions, etc.
  * [ ] Dwarves and Halflings working together.
* [ ] They've been trying to get the spies for a while after the previous success. They are sure they meet or leave messages in Deepwater Isle but they don't have the magical means (or skills) to ensure they aren't detected.
* [ ] As enforcers of the group they have been wearing second skins for ages to avoid the initial effects of the rings.
