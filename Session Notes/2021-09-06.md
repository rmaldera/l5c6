# Strong Start

### Recap:

* The party explored the crypt with the Goldsnatcher symbol. Among things you found the remains of someone who had several items of a player, a dragon hunter and Shelly Goldsnatcher - Selune's Cleric.
* The rest of the crypt had clear signs of having been "redecorated" not so long ago to have Shar imagery. Tamar got the group to punish the Shar cultists inside and remove the main statue.
* The group got to the bottom floor and over there they could see - through what seemed to be a transparent, shiny curtain - three figures fighting each other other what seemed to be robes and armor in the ground.
* After trying to shoot arrows towards them. Nessa put her hand inside and shot a fireball attracting their attention.

### Start:

* Fight!
