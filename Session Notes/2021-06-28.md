# Strong Start

### Recap:

* The party continues their journey north through the remains of the once verdant surroundings of Goldenfields now full of abandoned farms and devastation produced by the giants.
* At some point during their trip the party realises that cult activity was a thing around this area with several houses marked with embrace symbols, violence and 'sudden' migration of households.
* The party was not the only group roaming the area. Creatures feeding off the remnants of the battles and invasions were seen around and one of these intersected the party after they decided to make some distance from a pack seen afar.
* The party found a granary and decided to camp there for the night.

### Start:

* We start in the middle of the night with the watches being done.

# Scenes

* Nessa seeing an apparition from Xyrelor in her dreams.
* One survivor of the cult completely malnourished

# Secret and Clues

Check off when revealed.

* [x] The cult came directly after the giants left. They started recruiting people that felt in complete despair.
* [x] Several groups are still roaming around this area. Providing food for the cult.
* [ ] There are cultists from different areas of the Sword Coast but it seems the majority of the current group comes from Waterdeep
* [x] This area is becoming wild and even has other giants still roaming the land.
* [ ] It's not clear if it's related to the cult but there are conversations about a giant bat in Womford. People have disappeared and the cult has just provided another avenue.
