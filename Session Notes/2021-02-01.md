# Strong Start

### Recap:

The party went on their way to the cave. After some mishaps to get into the carriage and start their journey they manage to make good time towards Goldenfields. 

Fighting some people on the way to the city, the party impressed the carriage driver who reckoned they should be able to make good time to Goldenfields.

You decided to get there and rent some horses from the driver and the innkeeper. With the horses with you it didn't take you long to find the entrance of the cave marked with the giant skulls.

A day has passed...

### Start: Owlbear Rodeo!
