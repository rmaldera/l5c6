# Strong Start

### Recap:

* The party kept tabs on a couple of Stone Giants that were busy rebuilding part of the nearby construction into something else.
* They managed to evade the giants and continue their path towards the area around Womford.
* At some point, the party came across a malnourished survivor... someone that described how in this part of the world, cultists were taken people away, working in gangs and still roaming and looking for survivors. They had taken advantage of the giants attacks to gain leverage on the local populace. The person confirmed that the cult had a presence around the area and that Womford and Bargewright Inn had cultists now to the point that they overtook the local Zhentarim gang.
* As the group progressed, they suddenly entered an area with mysterious effects, long shadows, fog, thorny branches and a set of clothes/loot without a body... just a husk. Tamar detected an undead presence but decided against investigating and the party continued.
* Finally, you came across a halfling spy and for a brief exchange you convinced him that you were part of the cult following L5C6... the spy advanced that the cult knew by now that someone was tampering with the tendrils and the local cult leader Chalaska had sent the spy to check on the road.
* After hearing all this, the party decided to avoid the town and focus on getting to the location of the next artifact.

### Start:

* Evening, it will be nightfall by the time they get to their next destination.
