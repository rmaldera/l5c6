# Strong Start

### Recap:

* Among the different quests in front of the party, they are on their way to the Druidic Cloister to organise a heist and retrieve an artefact that will allow the [Gleaming Sun](..\Locations\Gleaming%20Sun.md) to skywrite at will. This will free the party from their agreement with the tavern, earn them money and a message related to the name of their band.
* After enjoying some time to reminisce about the past with *Brassik*, *Delsephine* and the rest of the crew, the party decided to make their way to the Druidic Cloister using an airship.
* On their way there, they were intercepted by what seem to be a huge galleon, an actual maritime ship shooting cannon balls and swerving next to them in what seem to be a ship using the clouds as their "sea".
* The ship ended being boarded by creatures that seemed to react to the party's blood. After dispatching them, the party realised that the hooks coudn't be cut and they decided to board the galleon and get their airship free.
* After investigating the deck, checking what seemed to be the remnants of a fight and retrieving a cutlass, the party triggered a fight with some reanimated skeletons which included a giant construct made out of bones.
* After dispatching the monsters on the deck, the party decided to go into the ship and find the hooks reels.
* The party checked the first level and after a brief discussions and checking the cannons that were being used for the initial "attack" they checked a dining room with a sizable treasure. The treasure was a mimc and the guests were ghouls! Fight ensued.

### Start:

* The party just finished the fight. People are licking their wounds.
