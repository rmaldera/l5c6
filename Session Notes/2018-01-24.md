## Recap

After having a pleasant at the Fireshear Inn, you woke up to the screams of alarm warning townsfolk about an incoming giant greatship that ended up crashing against the town’s harbor.

Interested in what was happening at Dasharra’s tower, you headed that way to find 3 frost giants attacking it. After some debate, you joined the fray and with the help of Dasharra and some of her mercenaries you dispatched the giants in a fearsome battle.

Among the giants belongings you found a rusty key which prompted you to visit the greatship after seeing Dasharra leave while her griffons circled the tower.

While approaching the ship, Guybrush was spotted by the giants and with the help of Freedom’s spiders everyone managed to stay hidden from them.

Inside the ship, [Nessa](..\Nessa.md) and Guybrush found treasure, cargo and a frost ray to their faces. After leaving the ship and evading the giants the party remained divided with Nessa and Guybrush hiding in a woodstack near the ship while the rest charged at a single giant battling town guards.
