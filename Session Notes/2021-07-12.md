# Strong Start

### Recap:

* After getting more information from the spy, the party decided to continue towards the location of the artifact. On their way, they went to investigate a group of malnourished farmers that was toiling not so far from their path. All the farmers had rings on them and were apathetic to the party's questions and reactions but didn't mind sharing how the cultists in Womford were getting food from them.
* After finding a place to camp, the dome was surrounded by invisible and shadowy creatures. The party decided to attack and get rid of them before much happened.

### Start:

* It's the aftermath of the battle. You just finished battling these figures and around you several dogs remain plus a figure covered in rags.
