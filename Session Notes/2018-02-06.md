## Recap

An action-packed session, started with a battle against a giant while our ship invaders hid nearby waiting for their chance to move. As the giant forces dwindled and started to retreat, Nessa and Guybrush got caught in the middle.

Nessa attempted to sink the greatship which prompted a tense battle with the guards you initially avoided. After some ingenuity such as Xyrelorâ€™s illusion to help Nessa escape you were successful and retreated before the rest of the invaders returned to the ship.

In the aftermath, you went around Fireshear looking for a figure of authority while assessing the damage on the town. You met a Dragonborn, Darva, who is one of the town leaders and head of the **Silver Triangle**.

After she promised to give you a letter of recommendation most of you went to rest with the exception of Guybrush who had a not-so-smooth break-in and was on his way back to the inn and Xyrelor who wanted to visit the Silver Triangle.
