# Strong Start

### Recap:

* The team finished their battle with the cultist group and found on them a note confirming they were the assassins sent for Centria who managed to track the group at some point in time.
* Reaching the summit of the Griffon, Iryanar went into the Ethereal Plane and managed to see two pillars, one coming from Deepwater Isle and the other one from the Mud Flats. Additionally, he was able to track the tendrils to a warehouse down in the dock ward.
* After the party spent the night at the summit, they hurried up and managed to get to the Halibut Spine just in time (and with their costumes) to talk with Diga about their next mission: seeding a variation of the beacons able to connect the Shadowfell with the Prime at a much smaller scale but with more intensity. They were introduced to Irom, a blue skinned orc that is going to scout for locations for the party.

### Start:

* You are exiting the Halibut Spine having been given leave by Diga and escorted by Irom.

# Secret and Clues

Check off when revealed.

* [ ] Diga changes the location of their meetups constantly. Just a few around town know where the next one is going to be. It's very likely that we won't meet here for weeks.
* [ ] Harpers are trying to do their best but their hand are tied. The murders across other cities put them in the wrong foot of the Lord's Alliance. They are hoping that helping the biggest city will give them some additional clout with authorities so they can relax.
* [ ] Spies around Waterdeep that are being quite obvious. It's a weird technique where one of them makes it obvious to draw your attention while in reality others are the one taking note of you, your possessions, etc.
  * [ ] Dwarves and Halflings working together.
* [ ] They've been trying to get the spies for a while after the previous success. They are sure they meet or leave messages in Deepwater Isle but they don't have the magical means (or skills) to ensure they aren't detected.
* [ ] As enforcers of the group they have been wearing second skins for ages to avoid the initial effects of the rings.
