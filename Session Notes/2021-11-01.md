# Strong Start

### Recap:

* The party cleared the area where an apparition had affected Iryanar. The party investigated the area after the fight and eventually find a secret passage to an office that seemed to have been used recently. Information about psionic energy and more contracts for Goldsnatcher mercenaries.
* Afterwards, the party found another closed door with an inscription together with some stone coins. Nessa managed to swiftly solve the instructions but for her troubles all she got was the memories of the first bar where she performed in front of an audience. The Three Legged Goose is where she felt like home and she cannot wait to show the rest of L5C6 how it looks like.

### Start:

* Nessa is about to open the door to show the rest of the party the tavern.

# Scenes

* Going inside and being fully affected by apparition
