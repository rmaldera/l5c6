# Recap

* *Markham Southwell* asked you to find about more giant activity around Icewind Dale. He suggested that bringing back a giant’s head from the region would do a lot to convince other towns that it was not just a concerted attack on Bryn Shander but that they are roaming the Savage Frontier.
* While getting the supplies for this task, *Augrek Brighthelm* asked you to go to Ironmaster and ask for reinforcements from her clan folk.
* *Duvessa Shane* mentioned that *Inirva Coldwater*, captain of the **Dancing Wave** might be interested in hiring adventurers like you and willing to provide passage and accommodations if you need to travel around the Sword Coast.
* *Sir Baric Nylef* Focused on finding the Weevil, plans to go to other towns: Fireshear, Luskan, Mirabar, Xantharl’s Keep. He’ll leave town soon.
  * Go to Neverwinter and look for *Sir Lanniver Strayl* and tell him about Baric’s whereabouts and Bryn Shander.
* *Thwip Ironbottom* advised you to visit [Everlund](..\Locations\Everlund.md) and seek out *Krowen Valharrow*, a wizard in Moongleam Tower that is known for sponsoring adventures.
