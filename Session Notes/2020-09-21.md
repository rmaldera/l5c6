# Strong Start

### Recap:

The party is finally back together!

Group South managed to move the chest back to Fairview leveraging the services of an expert carriage driver. Once there, they found Tridam, the investigator assigned by Lieutenant Abdal to check what clues were left behind by the cult.

Meanwhile, group north managed to come back from the market trying to solve what to do about the ring promise and charm. After asking for help to Captain Harkow, the party decided against paying to remove the charm on Nessa and left the ring they got to be investigated by the city guard.

Everyone went back to the market and people took positions around the stand waiting to see what would happen now that they've been offered two rings.

### Start:

After taking the rings there are several options:

Both of them are taken by the ring power. After answering Centria's questions they are asked to get into a teleportation circle.

1. If Centria feels confident, they go and meet Diga.
1. If she doesn't, they are teleported to a Gray Wolf barbarian pack to finish them.
