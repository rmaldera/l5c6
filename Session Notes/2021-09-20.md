# Strong Start

### Recap:

* Nessa went into a more intense connection to the source than before. As she went deeper to restore the connection to the artifacts there were more effects compared to before. Tremors around the crypt, extra-planar creatures and a direct probe into your minds. Nessa saw visions of horrific creatures and as she restarted the tendril connection and visualised the location of the creature
* Nessa finally sees where the creature is. A pillar 25 feet high that emanates undesirable things (intestines, mouths, eyes etc) and emotions (hunger, anger, despair etc), waves of psychic assaults.

### Start:

* Going back to Guybrush flashback.
* Starting from the crypt
