# Strong Start

### Recap:

* Silver Triangle
  
  * Several requests to Silver Triangle network including bombs, blacksmiths, portable forges and more.
  * You were told there is a list at the Mirabar Silver Triangle on behalf of the Battlehammer clan. People require the stamp from Bagna Dissison to retrieve the list from other locations.
  The team decided to go back to the Southern Ward and change in a pub with private booths. You took fake names (The Wild Hunt):
  
  * Nessa + Guybrush = Worf
  * Iryanar = Wesley Crusher
  * Tamar = Jean-Luc
  * Phillip = Riker

You made it to the Thirsty Throat before your meeting time and saw a busy bar although with very low quality drinks.

Diga finally arrived with a sizable cohort. The two things that caught your eye were Diga himself and a blue-skinned Half-Orc that arrived with him and greeted someone in the bar with the secret Harpers handshake.

"Worf" went to speak with Diga who already knew there was a party coming to meet with him. In what seemed to be a transactional conversation that he had more than once, he mentioned that your test will be to retrieve an artifact from a cave near Waterdeep where other adventurers have failed already.

You got an advance of 500 GP and Nessa got a Geas on her as additional insurance. You managed to negotiate and extra night after a quick calculation based on Diga's map where it would take you 3 days to get to the cave and come back.

### Start:

* The party is still at the bar and were getting ready to go and find horses/carriage to get to the cave at a reasonable pace.
