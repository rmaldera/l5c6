Campaign Time: Ukhtar (October) 1st
Weather: Fair

## Recap

* Your session began with a fierce conversation with Brazic about their close encounter with Iymrith and trying to understand exactly what they were going to be dealing with during their journey with you.
* The group took some time to choose where to go and the approximate location of your destination… an area around the Dessarin Valley near Goldenfields.
* On your way you spent your time in different activities: tinkering, learning how to pilot, exploring the ship and even fighting/humiliating barbarians.
* Everything came to a sudden halt as you got relatively close to an area where the farms seemed to be ravaged, the river had reduced flow, no livestock to be seen. This served as background to what was happening on the airship… after discussions to trade a brooch given by Nessa to Phillip as a ‘peace offering’ he decided to wear it falling into an stasis and seemingly transforming into another being…
