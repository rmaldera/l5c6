# Strong Start

### Recap:

* The party finished shopping in Goldenfields and after procuring horses they started to make their way towards the location that Nessa identified from her connection to the tendrils.
* As they started making their way north, the farmed fields started to make way to more desolation driven by the giants. The party decided to take shelter in an abandoned farm and in the middle of the night they were warned by their horses that something was afoot.
* Famished hill giants were making their way towards the horses to devour them! The party managed to stop them and then realise that they were sick.

### Start:

* The party just finished their long rest

# Scenes

* Dream sequence with Nessa
* Seeing the recovery and partial devastation on their way north.
* Arriving to Womford
* Fighting vampires on their way there.
* Getting to the next location and seeing the guards from the cult

# Secret and Clues

Check off when revealed.

* [x] Farmers tried to defend themselves from the giants
* [ ] People resorted to try to eat the giants themselves. It seems that other giants tried to copy them and that's what made them sick.
* [x] Some of the farmers defected to work for the cult. They left marks in their houses to let others know.
* [ ] The rest of the area is deserted and they can see in the distance the remains of gnolls prowling
* [ ] They can see some signs with the Womford crest warning about bats in the night.
* [ ] The cult has some scouts in the area and they have made themselves known to the group (with enough perception)
