**Campaign Time:**  Nightal (Dec) 2nd

# Session Notes

* Guybrush took the [The Ethereal Cutlass](..\Items\The%20Ethereal%20Cutlass.md)
* They put the treasure as part of the common pool.

# Secret and Clues

* [x] There was a beacon that airship drivers were avoiding coming from the Ardeep Forest
* [x] It seems that the beacon was attracting spectres that died horrible deaths
* [x] The beacon was clearly visible around 3am above the clouds.
* [x] Navigation was completely screwed up while the moon was early "new" all the time
* [ ] Different parts of the docks were attacked by cultists at different points
* [ ] Roge Phaley would be happy to receive another visit from the party. They could be a new benefactor for Looking for Abigail.
* [ ] There were nobles looking for more trips via airship due to the recent assassinations done by the Harpers in other cities. It seems they have been focusing on ships and carriages.
* [ ] There is a giant's keep ([Lyn Armaal](..\Locations\Lyn%20Armaal.md)) still roaming the skies. There have been sightings between *Loudwater* and *Parnast*.
* [ ] There are rumours of undead drakes now flying in the skies as well. They have increased since the Giants calmed down around the continent.
* [ ] The star mounts are known for the academics there. They would be wise to learn the name of the place in advance.

# Strong Start

### Recap:

* After enjoying some time to reminisce about the past with *Brassik*, *Delsephine* and the rest of the crew, the party decided to make their way to the Druidic Cloister using an airship.
* On their way there, they were intercepted by what seem to be a huge galleon, an actual maritime ship shooting cannon balls and swerving next to them in what seem to be a ship using the clouds as their "sea".
* The ship ended being boarded by creatures that seemed to react to the party's blood. 

### Start:

* The party is finishing the fight with the creatures.
