# Recap

* After dispatching the assassins in Hundelstone’s outskirts, you found a note signed by a *Justiciar Alwin* rewarding your deaths.
* You continued your way to Ironmaster and after some discussions with the guards you met *Gwert Brighthelm* who promised to discuss with their clan elders sending reinforcements to Bryn Shander and after a small chat with him he suggested going to Fireshear and learning how to ride griffons if you needed to travel as far as Everlund.
* On your way to Fireshear, you came across what seemed to be the remains of big battlefield, dozens of barbarian bodies and 2 giants. Following some tracks, you came across a wounded giant and after dispatching him you heard the calls to regroup under their Jarl’s orders.
