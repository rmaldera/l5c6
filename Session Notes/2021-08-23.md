# Strong Start

### Recap:

* The party finished defending themselves from the guards of the location. 10 heavily armored guards that came after the alert given by the scouts. 5 pairs who sported a known symbol to Tamar: a hand coming from the skies to bend a Waterdhavian gold coin - the goldsnatcher emblem.
* On the guards there were documents showing a retainer for 2GP a day. The party decided to hide in the forest and take a short rest to continue exploring their destination. They finally decided to visit the location in Nessa's vision. A crypt entrance with the Goldsnatcher symbol engraved at the top.

### Start:
