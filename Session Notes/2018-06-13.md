## Recap

Last session you made your way to the North District to meet with [Ulinarhi](..\NPC\Ulinarhi.md) at the Silver Guitar. The contrast with the Harbor was outstanding with luxurious clothes and manors all over the place. You arrived to your destination to find a very classy speakeasy with a band in place and a very distinguished clientele.

You made contact with Ulinarhi, a flamboyant Tiefling that asked to prove yourselves worthy of being the entertainment at one of his shindigs. After some negotiations with the band and a brilliant performance aided by the whole group, you got the gig as the second performers from the North to make it under Ulinarhi’s tutelage.

Since the gig is on the tenth day, you decided to rest and go around town. You went to Tamar’s dilapidated home as instructed by Alkali to find a flower outside. A Harper was waiting with news of an intercepted message and the possible location of some cultists. You decided to follow his lead and arrived to a small shack with four people, two burly men and two regular looking thugs.
